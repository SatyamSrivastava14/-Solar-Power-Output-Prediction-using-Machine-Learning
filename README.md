# Solar-Power-Output-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This GitHub repository presents a comprehensive solution for predicting solar power output using machine learning techniques. Solar energy, as a sustainable and renewable energy source, has gained significant attention in addressing environmental concerns and meeting energy demands. However, its intermittent nature poses challenges for effective integration into the grid. This project aims to address these challenges by providing a predictive model for solar power generation.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing:
The project begins with data collection from multiple sources, merging them into a single dataset. The dataset contains various parameters related to solar power generation, including environmental factors like temperature, irradiance, and relative humidity, as well as time-related information.

## Feature Engineering:
To enhance the predictive power of the model, feature engineering techniques are applied. Time-related features, such as month, hour, and day, are extracted from the timestamp. These features are then transformed into cyclic representations to capture the temporal patterns effectively.

## Data Visualization and Analysis:
Exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the dataset. Heatmaps are used to visualize the correlations between different features and the target variable, "Output Active Power [kWp]."

## Data Transformation:
The output variable is transformed using the PowerTransformer to achieve a more Gaussian distribution, improving the performance of machine learning models.

## Model Building and Evaluation:
A variety of machine learning models are implemented, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Each model is evaluated using relevant metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a test dataset.
## Conclusion:
This GitHub repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and renewable energy enthusiasts interested in harnessing the power of machine learning to improve the predictability of solar energy generation. By accurately forecasting solar power output, we can optimize energy management, reduce reliance on non-renewable energy sources, and contribute to a more sustainable future.
